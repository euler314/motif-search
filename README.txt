This is an experimental software implementation of
graph motif search utilizing the constrained multilinear 
sieving framework; cf.

   "Engineering motif search for large graphs",
   ALENEX15 Meeting on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments,
   5 January 2015, San Diego, CA.

This experimental software is supplied to accompany the 
aforementioned paper. 

The source code is configured for a gcc build to a native 
microarchitecture that must support the AVX2 and PCLMULQDQ 
instruction set extensions. Other builds are possible but 
require manual configuration of 'Makefile' and 'builds.h'.
